Chinese Postman Problem
1) Is it eulerian?
2) if yes, then sum of weights (or sum of road lengths)
else,
	match all odd vertices, sum of weights + extra weights due to duplicated edges


So...a couple of parts - 
1) Shortest path between odd degree vertices - Dijkstra's?
2) Find if graph is Eulerian - Fleury/Heirholzer?
